The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is a stock market index that shows how 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. The value of the Dow is not a weighted arithmetic mean and does not represent its component companies' market capitalization, but rather the sum of the price of one share of stock for each component company. The sum is corrected by a factor which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index.  It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, created by Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones &amp; Company co-founder Charles Dow. Currently owned by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&amp;P Global, it is the best known of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was originally published on February 16, 1885.
